###Current Errors###
* ` undefined method 'set' for main:Object (NoMethodError)` - Commented out that line and changed the configuration for the db to more closely relate a Rails app with ActiveRecord
* `NoMethodError: undefined method 'configure' for main:Object` - Still getting errors from `config/environments.rb`
